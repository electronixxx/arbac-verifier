# Arbac Verification Challenge - Security II
This simple script can be used to verify the reachability of simple ARBAC rules. It is composed
of a parser which parses an .arbac file written into a specific form (as explained
in the description pdf), and saves all itâ€™s elements into adeguate data structures.

Once the parsing is done, the analyzer starts analyzing the reachability of the target role.
First it executes the forward and backward slicing on the initial parsed
data in order to reduce the state space.

It is developed for the purpose of solving the third challenge of the
Security 2 course. In roughly 5 minutes it finds the reachabilities for all the 8
policies of the challenge, and so, obtain the flag as the concatenation of the
reachabilities expressed as zero or one.

## Implementation
A detailed report can be found [here](docs/report.pdf).

## Output
The output shows the state of the execution for each of the input policy. Furthermore it gives
details about the made reductions (using prunning algorithms) and the time of execution.
